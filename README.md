# Hi! I'm Erin, and I've been making software for 20+ years.

You'll find some of my open-source projects on this account, but it's also where
I fork repos, so there's quite a bit of noise! I've pinned some repos that I've
been working on recently, or you could check out the [projects section of my
website] for some of my favorites.

[projects section of my website]: https://erin.id.au/projects

Some of my projects have their own orgs:

- [Ghalactic Actions] — GitHub actions designed to feel like natural extensions
  of the GitHub experience.
- [makefiles.dev] — A library of opinionated Makefiles for popular programming
  languages.
- [Snout Router] — Experimental libraries for app routing.
- [Iconduit] — An experimental build system for image assets.
- [Eloquent] _(archived)_ — Lots of libraries I created when I was working in
  the PHP space.
- [Open PHP Error Specifications] _(archived)_ — An attempt at creating an open
  standard for PHP error handling.
